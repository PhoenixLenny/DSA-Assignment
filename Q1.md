Question 1: Big O Notation (Q1.md)

Big O notation describes the upper bound of an algorithm's runtime or space complexity as the input size grows. It focuses on the dominant term and ignores constant factors and lower-order terms.

Rules with Examples:

Constant Time (O(1)):
    * Accessing an element in an array by its index.
    * Example: `int element = array[0];`

Linear Time (O(n)):
    * Iterating through an array or linked list once.
    * Example: `for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) { ... }`

Quadratic Time (O(n^2)):
    * Nested loops, comparing each element with every other element.
    * Example: Nested for loops.

Logarithmic Time (O(log n)):
    * Binary search in a sorted array.
    * Example: algorithms that divide the problem size in half with each step.

Linearithmic Time (O(n log n)):
    * Efficient sorting algorithms like merge sort or heap sort.
    * Example: sorting a list.
