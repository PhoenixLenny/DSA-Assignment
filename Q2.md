2. Differentiate between arrays and linked lists in terms of:

Memory Allocation:

   Arrays:
        * Arrays allocate a contiguous block of memory. This means all elements are stored next to each other in memory.
        * The size of the array must be specified at the time of creation (static allocation in some languages, dynamic allocation with resizing in others).
        * Memory is pre-allocated, even if not all elements are used.
   Linked Lists:
        * Linked lists allocate memory dynamically. Each element (node) stores its data and a pointer (or reference) to the next element.
        * Memory allocation is non-contiguous. Nodes can be scattered throughout memory.
        * Memory is allocated as needed.

Performance:

  Arrays:
        Accessing Elements: O(1) - Constant time due to direct access using indices.
        Searching: O(n) in worst case, O(log n) if sorted using binary search.
        Memory locality: Arrays tend to have better memory locality, which can lead to better cache performance.
    Linked Lists:
       Accessing Elements: O(n) - Requires traversing the list from the head.
       Searching: O(n) - Requires traversing the list.
       Memory locality: Linked lists have poor memory locality, which can lead to cache misses.

Insertion and Deletion Operations:

    Arrays:
       Insertion/Deletion at the End: O(1) on average (if space is available).
       Insertion/Deletion in the Middle: O(n) - Requires shifting subsequent elements.
    Linked Lists:
        Insertion/Deletion at the Beginning: O(1) - Simply update pointers.
        Insertion/Deletion in the Middle: O(n) to find the location, O(1) to perform the actual insertion/deletion.
